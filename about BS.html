        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to MzieWood & deco, where craftsmanship meets creativity. We are a proudly family-run business with a passion for transforming spaces and crafting beautiful, functional wooden furniture. Founded by Aupaki Mzizi, a skilled woodworker with over 10 years of experience, our company specializes in custom-designed kitchen cupboards, built-in cabinets, and outdoor wooden furniture.

Every piece we create is built with precision, care, and a deep understanding of wood as both a natural material and a timeless design element. Whether you're renovating your kitchen or looking to enhance your outdoor space with stylish wooden chairs or benches, we are committed to delivering high-quality, durable pieces that reflect your taste and meet your needs.

At MzieWood & Deco, we believe in personal service, attention to detail, and long-lasting quality. No project is too big or too small â€” from modern kitchen installations to rustic outdoor furniture, we work closely with each client to bring their vision to life.

Let us help you turn your house into a home, one custom design at a time.</p>
